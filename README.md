# Reporting-System-Survey

In the survey data collection, there are criticisms and suggestions in free text format for various services and divisions. The purpose of the service being criticized and suggested by the respondents is analyzed in the section of criticisms and suggestions. With the existence of this survey reporting system, it becomes easier to display criticisms and suggestions according to specific services and divisions, thereby generating word clouds and survey statistics. This project requires natural language processing and sentiment analysis.
